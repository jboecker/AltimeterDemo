AltimeterDemo
=============

This sketch shows the A-10C Altimeter readout on a 128x64 OLED display connected to a [TI Tiva C Series Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads-connected.html#tabs).

Compile and flash with [Energia](http://energia.nu).

It requires my [modified version of the Adafruit_SSD1306 library](https://github.com/jboecker/Adafruit_SSD1306_Energia) that works with Energia. You will also need to add the Adafruit GFX library.

It should be easy enough to compile this in the Arduino IDE, although it may be too slow to display without glitches (I have not tested this).
